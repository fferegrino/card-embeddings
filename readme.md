## Creating card embeddings from co-ocurrence matrices

This is a demonstration of how to create embeddings for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards by exploiting the information intrinsically contained in player's decks.

Check out the [demo app](https://yu-gi-oh-recommender.streamlit.app/), or see the slides I prepared for my presentation at PyData London 2024 (to be added).
